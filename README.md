# SnapEmu: Open-source GUI IoT Platform Compatible with LoRaWAN/MQTT

![](img/01.png)

SnapEmu is an open-source GUI IoT platform fully R&D and mantanced by [Heltec Automation](https://heltec.org/)<sup>¬Æ</sup>, to simplify the integration and management of devices using **LoRaWAN** and **MQTT** protocols. It includes a [web platform](https://snapemu.com/) with a GUI interface, and its relevant [IOS](https://apps.apple.com/cn/app/snapemu/id6475621820) and [Android apps](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.heltec.snapemu_app), which can analyze, store and display various data in real-time.

You can use the existing [SnapEmu public platform](https://snapemu.com/) to quickly deploy IoT applications, or you can deploy it locally (Your cloud server, edge computing device, Raspberry Pi, etc.), **and the locally deployed SnapEmu can be used as the data source of the APP**.
